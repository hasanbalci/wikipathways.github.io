  title: A complete map of the Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase
    2 (CAMKK2) signaling pathway (2020)
communities: []
description: CaMKK2 is a 66Ã¢â‚¬â€œ68-kDa serine kinase, consists of unique N- and
  C-terminal domains and a central Ser/Thr-directed kinase domain that is followed
  by a regulatory domain composed of overlapping autoinhibitory and CaM-binding regions
  (PMID:9335539). CAMKK2 is activated once calmodulin (CALM1) binds with CAAMKK2.
  The most well-characterized substrates of CaMKK2 are CaMKI, CaMKIV and AMPKÃŽÂ±.
  CaMKK2 phosphorylates CaMKIV, CaMKI and AMPKÃŽÂ± on activation loop Thr residues
  (Thr-200, Thr-177 and Thr-172, respectively), which increases their kinase activities
  (PMID:9822657). CaMKK2 is present in many areas of the brain, including the olfactory
  bulb, hippocampus, dentate gyrus, amygdala, hypothalamus, and cerebellum (PMID:9822657,
  12654522). The creation of this pathway is described in [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33136287/
  Najar et al].
