description: '"Prior to fertilization, C. elegans oocytes are arrested in meiotic
  prophase with nuclei containing two copies of the diploid genome packaged into recombined
  bivalent chromosomes. The two rounds of meiotic chromosome segregation that generate
  the haploid oocyte pronucleus are completed in the zygote after the oocytes are
  fertilized. During each meiotic division, chromosome segregation is accomplished
  by a small acentriolar meiotic spindle that forms in the embryo anterior. During
  anaphase of meiosis I and again in meiosis II, the meiotic spindle associates with
  the cortex in an end-on fashion, and a highly asymmetric cytokinesis-like event
  extrudes a polar body (Figure 2; Albertson and Thomson, 1993; Clark-Maguire and
  Mains, 1994; Yang et al., 2003). In addition to the haploid pronucleus, the sperm
  brings a pair of centrioles into the oocyte, which lacks centrioles due to their
  degradation during oogenesis. As meiosis completes, the haploid oocyte and sperm-derived
  pronuclei, located at opposite ends of the embryo increase in size, becoming visible
  by DIC microscopy. After entering the oocyte, the sperm-derived centriole pair recruits
  pericentriolar material and acquires the ability to nucleate microtubules (O''Connell,
  2000; Pelletier et al., 2004). Subsequently, the two sperm-derived centrioles separate,
  forming two centrosomes positioned on either side of the paternal pronucleus. Coincident
  with chromosome condensation during mitotic prophase, the pronuclei migrate towards
  each other. After the pronuclei meet, the nuclear-centrosome complex moves to the
  center of the embryo and rotates to align with the long axis of the embryo (Albertson,
  1984; Hyman and White, 1987). The miotitc spindle begins to move towards the embryo
  posterior during metaphase (Labbe et al., 2004; Oegema et al., 2001), and asymmetric
  elongation during anaphase contributes to its posterior displacement (Albertson,
  1984; Grill et al., 2001). Since the cleavage furrow bisects the mitotic spindle,
  this displacement results in an asymmetric first cleavage (For more on the mechanisms
  that generate this asymmetry see Asymmetric cell division and axis formation in
  the embryo). "  From "Cell division" by Karen Oegema, WormBook'
