description: 'EGF signaling is a key pathway involved in vulval patterning. Vulval
  precursor cell patterning requires input and cooperation between both EGF LIN-3
  graded signaling through LET-23 as well as a sequential, subordinate signal involving
  DSL ligands acting via LIN-12. See figure 8 here: http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_vulvaldev/vulvaldev.pdf'
