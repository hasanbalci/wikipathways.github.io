description: Electronegative LDL (LDL(-)) is a plasma LDL subfraction inducing induces
  cytokine release in monocytes by activating TLR4. The subsequent phosphorylation
  of p38 MAPK phosphorylation (which is higher compared to native LDL) through TLR4
  and PI3k/Akt pathways activates NF-kB, AP-1 and CREB. These last three have a direct
  effect on four cytokines (IL1B, IL6, IL10 and MCP1), with bold black letters for
  the highest level of cytokine induction, gray letters for the lowest level and regular
  letter for the intermediate induction.
