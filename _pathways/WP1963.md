description: 'This pathway provides a clear view of the effects of Glucocorticoids
  on target gene expression when binding to the GR (glucocorticoid receptor). Inhibiting
  and activiting effects are given as a result of target gene activation. It summarizes
  the article of Pelaia et al, 2002, which explains the pathway very detailed.  '
