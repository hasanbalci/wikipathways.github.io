description: 'Caenorhabditis elegans males exhibit sterotypic and invariant mating
  behavior starting the moment the animal senses a hermaphrodite and ending with insemination.  This
  complex behavior has been broken down into six steps or sub behaviors: male response
  to hermaphrodite contact, backwards movement along her body, sharply turning in
  a ventral coil upon reaching the head or tail, continued backing until his tail
  contacts the vulva (vulval location), spicule insertion, and ejaculation into the
  hermaphrodite uterus. Each of these sub behaviors have been molecularly dissected
  and it has been found that two of these sub behaviors, male response to hermaphrodite
  contact and vulval location involve similar molecules.  In particular these behaviors
  involve cell autonomous signaling through LOV-1 and PKD-2, which are homologs of
  human polycystin kidney disease (PKD) associated genes PC-1 and PC-2 respectively.
  Studies in C. elegans have shown that these genes likely have a sensory function
  rather than structural or development role in the cilia of male sensory neurons.
  The identification and characterization of LOV-1 and PKD-2 in C. elegans has lead
  to insights and new avenues of inquiry in the study of human PKD polycystin pathways.'
