description: 'Synthesis of ceramides and 1-deoxyceramides from serine and alanine,
  respectively, including the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids in humans. Multiple
  complex sphingolipid synthesis reactions were added to improve pathway versatility.
  1-Deoxyceramide synthesis shows many similarities with ceramide synthesis but has
  much less documentation, hence this comprehensive figure. '
