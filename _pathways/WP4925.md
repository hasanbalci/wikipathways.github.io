description: The unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway regulates and protects the
  cell from improperly folded protein overload in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
  UPR can result in the slowing of protein synthesis, which gives the cell time to
  translate more chaperones to help process the proteins. If the stress is too high,
  UPR can eventually trigger apoptosis.
