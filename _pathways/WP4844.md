description: 'This pathway represents the different molecular interactions that may
  occur following the dis-regulation of signaling pathways in adipocyte differentiation
  and proliferation.  That may result in the abnormal distribution of white adipose
  tissue, leading to the onset of lipodystrophic syndromes.  This laminopathic pathway
  stems from mutations mainly occurring in the LMNA gene, and can be associated with
  the onset of other laminopathic syndromes due to a malfunction in the lamin A processing
  pathway.  Other laminopathic diseases are associated with LMNA mutations, thus this
  pathway represents the overlapping interactions in such phenotypic diseases. '
