description: 'Pyrimidine nucleotides are essential as components of nucleic acids,
  as substrates for amino acid synthesis and as energy sources, but defects in the
  de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines are not lethal in S. cerevisiae cells  (CITS:10501935).  This
  is because salvage pathways are able to utilize preformed bases (either from exogenous
  sources or internal turnover sources) for the synthesis of pyrimidines (CITS:2189783).
  If the required substrates are available, salvage pathways are preferred over de
  novo synthesis pathways for pyrimidine biosynthesis (CITS:12111094).  The salvage
  pathways of pyrimidine ribonucleotides consist of 1) importing exogenous bases into
  the cell, and 2) the interconversion of various bases (CITS:2189783)(CITS:12111094).
  Three proteins are involved in the import of exogenous bases used by the salvage
  pathway for pyrimidine ribonucleotide biosynthesis. Uracil enters the cell via the
  Fur4p uracil permease (CITS:6290876)(CITS:3276521), cytosine enters the cell via
  the Fcy2p purine-cytosine transporter (CITS:6387700)(CITS:2191181), and uridine
  enters the cell via the Fui1p uridine permease (CITS:9485596).  As with many of
  the metabolic pathways of S. cerevisiae, the pathways for the salvage of pyrimidine
  ribonucleotides are under both transcriptional and post-transcriptional catabolite
  repression at a variety of points  (CITS:10074071)(CITS:11125145)(CITS:12111094)(CITS:12570998)(CITS:12791685)(CITS:1429716)(CITS:14657252).  This
  pathway is of biomedical interest because cytosine deaminase (Fcy1p) is not found
  in mammals (CITS:12637534) and is capable of catalyzing the deamination of the prodrug
  5-fluorocytosine (5FC) to form the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (CITS:15823054).
  Expression of Fcy1p in tumor cells increases their sensitivity to 5FC, and expression
  of Fur1p increases tumor cell sensitivity to 5FU (CITS:10919655). Tumor cells expressing
  a novel chimeric protein, produced from a gene containing the FCY1 and FUR1 coding
  sequences fused in frame, display significantly increased sensitivity to 5-FC suggesting
  that this novel suicide gene may constitute an original and potent candidate therapeutic
  gene for cancer gene therapy (CITS:10919655).   SOURCE: SGD pathways, http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/server.html'
