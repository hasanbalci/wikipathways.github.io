description: '"Proposed mechanism. Both H2S and HCN can inhibit electron transport.
  Electron transport inhibition causes induction of HIF-1 activity resulting in high
  expression of SQRD-1 and CYSL-2. SQRD-1 catalyzes the first step in the H2S-oxidation
  pathway, ultimately resulting in production of sulfate and thiosulfate. CYSL-2 catalyzes
  the first step in the HCN assimilation pathway, producing H2S. The resultant H2S
  is detoxified by CYSL-1."'
