description: Cancer related cachexia is a metabolic disease that is defined by an
  increased breakdown of muscle protein. Muscle breakdown in cachexia occurs mostly
  due to activation of either the ubiquitin proteasome system, or the autophagy lysosomal
  system. In this pathway an overview is presented of the different mechanisms that
  have been found to activate these two systems involved in muscle degradation.
