description: 'JAK-STAT signaling participates in the regulation of key biological
  processes in Beta-cells, including cell proliferation. Janus kinases (JAKs) serve
  as a fundamental switch that trigger signal transducer and activator of transcription
  (STAT) proteins through phosphorylation, which enables downstream target activation
  and subsequent regulation of target gene transcription. Suppressors of cytokine
  signaling (SOCS) are negative modulators of JAK-STAT signaling. This pathway is
  based on a figure by Jiang et al. (2018, doi: 10.3892/etm.2018.6603). '
