description: 'Proposed metabolic pathway of flavan-3-ols (also known as flavanols)
  in humans. Flavanols are derivatives of flavans and include catechin, epicatechin
  gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, proanthocyanidins, theaflavins,
  thearubigins.  These compounds differ considerably not only in their structural
  and functional properties, but also in their metabolism and bioavailability. Green
  arrows indicate microbiota-mediated steps, and red arrows represent mammalian enzyme-mediated
  conversions. Pink arrows indicate steps that can be both microbiota- or enzyme-mediated.
  This pathway was developed based upon 22 papers; black arrows indicate missing information
  regarding the nature of conversion. Acknowledgements: This pathway is based upon
  work from COST Action POSITIVe, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science
  and Technology).'
