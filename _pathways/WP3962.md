description: Adapted from figure 7 from Chun et al (see Bibliography). Cu homeostasis
  in worms is maintained by distinctly localized intestinal CUA-1 isoforms. A model
  of Cu homeostasis in C. elegans is shown. Dietary Cu ions are transported from the
  lumen of the intestine to the enterocytes by an unidentified Cu importer, and CUC-1
  delivers Cu to CUA-1. Under basal Cu or Cu-deficient conditions, CUA-1.1 isoform
  localizes to the basolateral membrane and Golgi to either export Cu ions to peripheral
  tissues, or to direct Cu into the secretory pathway. CUA-1.2 consistently localizes
  to the basolateral membrane of enterocytes regardless of Cu conditions. CUA-1.1
  is redistributed to the gut-granule membranes in response to elevated Cu levels
  in order to promote Cu detoxification in C. elegans."
