description: 'DUX4 downstream signaling in FSHD. Low D4Z4 subunit methylation, which
  is caused either by low amount of D4Z4 subunits combined with a permissive 4q haplotype,
  or a mutation in genes involved with D4Z4 methylation, results in the expression
  of DUX4. Normally, DUX4 is only expressed during embryogenesis, after which it is
  silenced. Abnormal activation of DUX4 after silencing results in the muscle disease
  known as facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, or FSHD. '
